        <p>The program doesn't work perfectly as words are searched for randomly with no algorithm. For this reason, not all possible combinations will always be found, however you should still hit generate a couple of times before giving up on it because you might get lucky! It also works better with medium sized words (small words return lots of combinations and large words take a long time to find).</p>
